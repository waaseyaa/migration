/**
 * Per-migration filesystem advisory lock.
 *
 * One {@see MigrationLock} instance gates one `(<migration-id>)` pair. The
 * lock file lives at `<lockDir>/<migration-id>.lock` and is held via
 * `flock($handle, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`. Inside the handle the holder writes
 * its `getmypid()` so operators inspecting a stale lock can see who owns
 * it.
 *
 * Acquisition is **non-blocking**. A failed acquire raises
 * {@see MigrationConcurrencyException} — blocking acquisition would create
 * silent multi-minute waits in CI that confuse operators (see reviewer
 * guidance on this WP).
 *
 * Release is best-effort and idempotent:
 *
 *  - explicit `release()` is called from the `finally` block of every
 *    `import:*` command;
 *  - `pcntl_signal()` handlers (SIGTERM / SIGINT) call `release()` when
 *    the extension is available;
 *  - `register_shutdown_function()` calls `release()` on script teardown
 *    for SAPIs that lack pcntl (e.g. Windows).
 *
 * Stale locks (process died without releasing) are NOT auto-removed.
 * Per spec §9.3 (decision D11), PID reuse on long-running hosts would make
 * accidental concurrent runs silent — operators must remove the file by
 * hand. {@see MigrationConcurrencyException}'s message documents the
 * recovery command.
 *
 * Thread-safety: this class is single-process. Multiple instances against
 * the same migration id in the same PHP process are not supported — the
 * second acquire will succeed against the kernel's own lock entry. Tests
 * exercising contention use `pcntl_fork()` to put the two instances in
 * separate processes.
 *
 * @api
 *
 * @spec FR-061 — per-migration concurrency lock
 * @spec FR-062 — graceful release on SIGTERM/SIGINT
