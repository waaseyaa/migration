/**
 * Provider capability that contributes concrete {@see MigrationDefinition}
 * instances to {@see MigrationRegistry} at boot time (FR-013).
 *
 * Parallel to {@see HasMigrationPluginsInterface}: where `HasMigrationPluginsInterface`
 * ships *plugin* classes (sources, processes, destinations) for any migration
 * to compose, this interface ships *whole migrations* — fully-formed manifests
 * authored against the plugin contracts.
 *
 * Migrations may also be registered via the filesystem fallback
 * (`migration.manifest_paths` in `config/waaseyaa.php`), scanned by
 * {@see FilesystemManifestLoader}. Both mechanisms feed the same registry.
 *
 * **When to use which:**
 *
 * - Implement this interface on a `ServiceProvider` shipping migrations as
 *   first-class package surface — e.g. a WordPress-content source-reader
 *   package that ships ready-made `wp_users_to_accounts`, `wp_posts_to_teachings`
 *   manifests.
 * - Use the filesystem fallback for application-specific one-off migrations
 *   that don't warrant their own package.
